# Tutorial Intro

This is a simpler interpretation of the ORAS docs. I am a contributor to the project and wanted to help other contributors get started with ORAS, which can be really tough if you are reading from ORAS docs, like it was for me.

I have tried to simplify whatever was present in the docs and also collect everything one needs to contribute to ORAS at a single place. From OCI to Notary, you get everything in this tutorial which is missing in the official Docs.

- These are in no way intended to be the official docs of ORAS project. You can find the official docs in [oras.land](https://oras.land)
